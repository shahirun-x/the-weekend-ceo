__NO ORDINARY TOUCHES\. ONLY THE CEOΓÇÖS TOUCH\. FOR THOSE WHO REFUSE THE ORDINARY\. __

Founder\-led Luxury automotive craftsmanship delivered at your doorstep ΓÇô Your home, Your Office, or Your Private Spaces ΓÇö Executed with the restraint, respect, and discipline found in elite global detailing ateliers\.

A car is never just transport\.  
It is an asset\. An expression\. An Emotion\. A reflection of its owner ΓÇö even when parked still\.

The Weekend CEO was born from a belief that extraordinary cars demand patience, discipline, and leadership\.

  
__Not routines\. Not rush\. Not volume\. Not Shortcuts\. Not Offers __

Every vehicle is treated as a prized asset ΓÇö and every touch carries responsibility\.

__*Some cars are driven\.  
Some cars are lived with\.*__

__*The Weekend CEO is for who can differentiate this\.*__

__THE IDEA BEHIND THE WEEKEND CEO__

By weekdays, the founder operates as a senior corporate leader ΓÇö accountable for people, processes, performance, and outcomes, in an environment where standards are non\-negotiable and time is the most valuable currency\.

By weekends, that same leadership becomes deeply personal\.

__The Weekend CEO__ is where entrepreneurship, ownership, and a lifelong passion for cars converge ΓÇö guided by the same CEO mindset, now expressed through hands\-on craftsmanship instead of boardrooms and presentations\.

This duality is intentional\.

Corporate leadership builds structure, systems, discipline, and respect for time\.  
Entrepreneurship fuels obsession, pride, accountability, and care beyond obligation\.

The Weekend CEO exists at the intersection of both ΓÇö where professional rigour meets personal passion, and where __time is invested, not spent__\.

This is not a side activity\.  
It is a __founder\-led boutique automotive brand__, deliberately limited in scale, where every car receives undivided, CEO\-level ownership and involvement ΓÇö from the first touch to the final inspection\. 

__Our Approach\.__

__What Makes Us Unique & Different?__

The Weekend CEO positions itself as one of __IndiaΓÇÖs most premium and expensive forms of automotive craftmanship__ ΓÇö by choice, not by claim\.

This IsnΓÇÖt your regular car wash\. This is a statement\. Every vehicle we touch undergoes a transformation guided by obsession attention to detail and a refusal to cut corners\. We do not believe premium automotive care belongs in crowded studios, mechanic sheds or mass execution\. We believe it belongs in calm environments, controlled preparation, methodical execution\.

*We do not seal paint using ceramic coatings, PPF installations or deliver false longevity promises, or marketing\-driven warranty statements\. *

Instead, we focus on __detailing in its purest and most demanding form__:

__PURE CRAFTSMANSHIP __

- Advanced paint correction and surface refinement
- Elite German waxes, sealants, and detailing systems applied by hand\. The wax gives protection and keeps the paint open and original for future corrections or changes\.
- Techniques that prioritise __depth, clarity, warmth, and tactile perfection__

Our results are __visible to the eye, felt by the hand, and understood by enthusiasts__ ΓÇö not hidden behind claims or paperwork\. This approach requires judgement, restraint, and time and that is precisely why it cannot be mass\-produced\.
